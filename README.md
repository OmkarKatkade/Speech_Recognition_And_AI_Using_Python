# Speech_Recognition_And_AI_Using_Python
This program allows the user to speak to the program (just like SIRI or Google Assistant), uses python's speech recognition library to convert the speech to text,
understands it and googles the question asked by the user (if any) and then uses web scrapping using selenium to fetch the most appropriate result from the google-search
and responds back by speaking the result received.

Input to the Program: Speech (from the User)
Output of the Program: Speech (from the Machine)
